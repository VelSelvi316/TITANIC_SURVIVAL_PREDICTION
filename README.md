# Titanic Survival Prediction

## 📌 Objective
Predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using various features such as age, gender, passenger class, fare, and more.

## 📁 Dataset
[Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brendan45774/test-file)

## 🔧 Steps to Run the Project

2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train and evaluate the model.

## 🛠️ Preprocessing
- Handled missing values (e.g., Age, Cabin)
- Encoded categorical variables (`Sex`, `Embarked`, `Pclass`)
- Normalized numerical features

## 🤖 Model
- Random Forest Classifier
- Trained on `train.csv` with test split
- Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall

## 📊 Results
Includes a confusion matrix and classification report for model evaluation.
